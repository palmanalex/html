There are a thousand things to do and see in Paris and however much time you have here, it won’t be enough:

Climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, stroll down the Champs Elysées, visit the Louvre, see many shows and exhibitions, or simply wander along the banks of the Seine...read in French in the Tuileries garden, and quite simply take the time to experience the Parisian way of life!

Stepping into this whirlwind that takes you from frenzy to romanticism will leave you with enduring memories. You will be much more proficient in French and you will become aware of your ability to communicate in the language of Molière.
